# Topic:
Customized Virtual File System  (CVFS).  

# Introduction:  

o The purpose of this project is to use the C programming language to develop a simple Customised Virtual File System (CVFS).   
 
o CVFS serves as a "manager" for files and folders on a computer's hard drive.  
 
o It makes it easier for users to deal with files by providing commands such as Lseek, Create, RM, LS, Stat, and Fstat.  

o I Provide All Implementations Of Necessary System Calls And Commands Of File subsystem As : Open, Close, Read, Write, Lseek, Create, RM, LS, Stat, Fstat etc.  

o While Creating This Project All Above Functionality I Use Our Own Data Structures By Referring Algorithms of UNIX Operating System.  

o By Using This Project I Can Get Overview Of UFS (UNIX File System) On Any Platform.
