CPP Programming
# Introduction:
A powerful, general-purpose programming language known for its versatility, allowing developers to create high-performance applications with direct control over system resources, often used in areas like game development, system software, and embedded systemsit is considered a middle-level language, combining features of both high-level and low-level programming, and is based on object-oriented programming principles, allowing for code organization using classes and objects;  
developed by Bjarne Stroustup, C++ is an extension of the C programming language, offering additional features like data encapsulation and inheritance;  
# key aspects of C++ include:
# Object-Oriented Programming:
C++ allows for the creation of classes and objects, enabling code reusability and modularity by defining data structures (attributes) and associated functions (methods) within a class. 
# Memory Management:
Unlike some higher-level languages, C++ provides direct memory access, giving programmers fine-grained control over memory allocation and deallocation, which can be crucial for performance-critical applications. 
# Generic Programming:
C++ supports templates, enabling the creation of generic code that can work with different data types, promoting code flexibility and reusability.
